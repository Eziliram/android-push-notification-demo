# Mama Money Frontend Technical Assessment

## Overview

This technical assessment evaluates your ability to implement a push notification and content card inbox system using the Braze SDK in an Ionic/Angular mobile application.

## Flow

1. Homepage: Send custom event "INBOX_MESSAGE_TEST" via Braze SDK
   - Implemented in [`HomePage`](src/app/home/home.page.ts)
   - Triggers Braze campaign to send push notification

2. Push Notification: Handle incoming notification
   - [`PushNotificationService`](src/app/shared/services/push-notification.service.ts) receives notification
   - Check if notification type is 'inbox'
   - Trigger content card fetch

3. Content Cards: Fetch and filter
   - Fetch contend cards from Braze
   - Filter cards with type 'inbox'
   - Update inbox state

4. UI Updates: Reflect new messages
   - [`InboxButtonComponent`](src/app/shared/components/inbox-button/inbox-button.component.ts) shows unread indicator
   - Animate notification icon
   - Update inbox card list

5. Navigation: Handle card interactions
   - Log card impressions when viewed
   - Handle deep links for navigation
   - Manage card dismissal

## Objective

Implement a fully functional Braze push notification and content card inbox system that demonstrates your understanding of mobile application development, state management, and third-party SDK integration.

## Requirements

### 1. Custom Event Implementation

- Implement the [`sendInboxTestEvent`](src/app/home/home.page.ts) method in the homepage to trigger a custom "INBOX_MESSAGE_TEST" event using the [`Braze SDK`](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/home)
- This event will trigger a push notification from Braze containing a new content card

### 2. Push Notification Handling

- Complete the implementation of [`PushNotificationService`](src/app/shared/services/push-notification.service.ts)
  - Implement the TODO in `pushNotificationReceived` listener to check if notification is from Braze (type === 'inbox' in extras) and refetch content cards from Braze

### 3. Inbox Implementation

- Build the [`InboxComponent`](src/app/shared/components/inbox/inbox.component.ts) according to the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/Xj5g90AVLs4HIycMGkF7Ef/Mama-Money-Frontend-Assessment---Inbox?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=jph71z20fRpKQabb-1):
  - Implement the inbox UI following the provided design system
  - Update inbox cards array when new content is available
  - Implement card dismissal functionality with confirmation dialog
  - Handle deep linking for card URLs

## Reviewer setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure the following are installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Ionic CLI
- Android Studio with an Android SDK and emulator, or a connected Android device
- A compatible JDK configured for Android builds

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and copy the supplied values into it:

```env
BRAZE_ANDROID_KEY=
BRAZE_ENDPOINT=
FCM_SENDER_ID=
```

These values are used when Capacitor generates the Android configuration. The `.env` file is ignored by Git and
should not be committed.

### Install and run

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Choose the commands for your operating system.

#### macOS or Linux

```bash
npm run build:android
npm run start:android
```

#### Windows

```bash
npm run build:android:win
npm run start:android:win
```

The start command opens the Android target through Capacitor with live reload. Select an emulator or connected device
when prompted.

When the app opens for the first time, allow notification permission so the push notification flow can be tested.

### Run the checks

To run linting, formatting checks, and unit tests:

```bash
npm run verify
```

The individual checks can also be run with `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, and `npm test`.

## Notes

- You are only required to develop for Android
- The existing codebase includes guidance comments(Search codebase for TODO's), but you are encouraged to implement solutions that you believe best demonstrate your expertise
- Follow Angular best practices and maintain consistent code style

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality and organization
- Implementation of required features
- Understanding of Angular/Ionic patterns
- Integration with Braze SDK
- Mobile development best practices
- TypeScript Proficiency:
  - Demonstrates strong TypeScript fundamentals
  - Thoughtful use of interfaces, types, and enums
  - Accurately types services, components, and SDK interactions
  - Avoids unnecessary any and JavaScript-style patterns
